            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>CHAP. XXV. An Act for the prevention of Vexations and Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions by Arrests; And of Delays in Suits of Law.</head>
            <p>WHereas by the Laws of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, in Case where any Person is Sued, Impleaded or Arrested by any Writt, Bill or Process, Issu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of any of his Majesties Courts of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, at <hi>Dublin,</hi> in any Common Plea, at the Suit of any Common Person, The True Cause of Action ought to be set forth and Expressed in such Writt, Bill or Process, whereby the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant may have certain Knowledge of the Cause of the Suit; and the Officer who shall Execute such Writt, Bill or Process, may know how to take Security for the Appearance of the Defendant to the same, and the Sureties for such Appearance may rightly understand for what Cause they become Engaged.</p>
            <p>And whereas there is a great Complaint of the People of this Kingdom, that for Divers Years last past, very many of His Majesties Good Subjects have beÃ©n Arrested upon General Writts of Trespass, <hi>Quare Clausum Fregit,</hi> or other like Writts Issued out of the Courts of <hi>Kings-Bench,</hi> and <hi>Common-Pleas,</hi> not Expressing any Particular or Certain Cause of Action; and thereupon kept Prisoners for a long time for want of Bail, Bonds, with Sureties for Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances, having beÃ©n Demanded in so great
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:207793:3"/> Summs, that few or none have Dared to be Security for the Appearance of such Persons so Arrested and Imprisoned; altho in Truth there hath beÃ©n little or no Cause of Action, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes there are no such Persons who are Named Plantiffs; but those Arrests have beÃ©n many times procured by Malicious Persons to Vex and Oppress the Defendants, and to force from them Vnreasonable and Vnjust Composi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for Obtaining their Liberty; and by such Evil Practices many Men have beÃ©n, and are Daily Vndone, and Destroyed in their Estates, without Possibility of having Reparation, the Actors Imployed in such Practices having beÃ©n (for the most part) Poor and Lurking Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and their Actings Secret, that it hath beÃ©n found very Difficult to make True Disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries on proof thereof.</p>
            <p>For Remedy and prevention of which so great growing Evils and Mischiefs; And also for Discouraging all Frivolous and Vnjust Suits and Causeless Arrests for the Future.</p>
            <p>Be it Enacted by the Kings Most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons in this present Parliament Assembled, and by Authority of the same, That from and after the Twelfth Day of <hi>December</hi> next, no Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son or Persons who shall happen to be Arrested by any Sheriff, Vnder-Sheriff, Coroner, Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard or Bayliff of any Franchize or Liberty, or by any other Officer, Minister, Vnder-Bayliff, or any other Person or Persons whatsoever within this Realm, having or pretending to have Authority or Warrant in that behalf, by force
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:207793:3"/> or Colour of any Writt, Bill, or Process, Issu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or to be Issuing out of His Majesties said Court of <hi>Kings-Bench</hi> and <hi>Common-Pleas,</hi> or ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them, or other Court of Iustice, in which said Writt, Bill, or Process, or at the Foot thereof, the Certainty or True Cause of Action is not Expressed, Marked, or Set Down par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly; and for which the Defendant or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendants in such Writt, Bill, or Process Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med is and are Bailable by the Statute in that behalf made in the ThreÃ© and Twentieth Year of the Reign of the Late King <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth, shall be Forced or Compelled to give Security, or to Enter into Bond with Sureties for the Appearances of such Person or Persons so Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rested, at the day and place in the said Writs, Bill, or Process, on the Foot thereof Specified or Contained in any Penalty or Summ of Money exceÃ©ding the Summ of Forty Pounds of Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Money of <hi>England,</hi> to be Conditioned for such Appearances. And that all Sheriffs and other Officers and Ministers aforesaid, shall let to Bail, and Deliver out of Prison, and from their and Every of their Custodies, Respectively, all and every person or persons whatsoever, by them, or any of them Arrested upon any such Writt, Bill, or Process wherein the Certainty and True Cause of Action is not particularly Expressed, as aforesaid, upon Security in the summ of Forty pounds, and no more, given for Appearance of such person or persons so Arrested, unto the said Sheriff or Officer aforesaid, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the said Statute in the said ThreÃ© and Twentieth Year of the Reign of the said King <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth, in that behalf made and Provided.</p>

            <p>Provided always that this Act, nor any Clause or Thing herein before Specified or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained shall not Extend or be Construed or Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to Extend unto any Arrests hereafter to be made upon, or by Vertue of any Writt of <hi>Capias Utlagatum,</hi> Attachment upon Rescous, or Attachment upon any Contempt, or of any At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment of Priviledge, at the Suit of any Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledged person, or of any other Attachment for Contempt whatsoever, Issuing, or to be Issuing out of Either of the said Courts, altho there be no particular Certainty of the Cause of Action Expressed or Contained in the said Writts, but that Nevertheless no Sheriff or Vnder-Sheriff, nor any of the Officers or Ministers aforesaid, shall Discharge any person or persons taken upon any Writt of <hi>Capias Utlagatum,</hi> out of Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stody without a Lawful <hi>Supersedeas</hi> first had and Received for the same, and that upon the said Writts of Attachment such Lawful Course be taken for Security for Appearance therein, as hath beÃ©n heretofore Vsed, any thing herein before Expressed to the Contrary thereof in any wise Notwithstanding.</p>
            <p>And whereas many persons-out of ill Intent to Delay their Creditors from Recovering their Iust Debts continue Prisoners, who cannot be proceÃ©ded against in such manner as they might be if they were at Large. Now for the better Enabling all and Every person or persons to Recover their Iust Debts and Demands against such Prisoners.</p>
            <pb n="8" facs="tcp:207793:5"/>
            <p>Be it further Enacted by the Authority a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid, That Every person or persons what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever who now hath or have, or which at any time hereafter shall have Cause of any personal Action against any person, being a Prisoner in Prison, may Sue forth any Original Writt upon his or their Cause of Action: And that a Writt of <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> be granted to Every such person or persons being Plantiff or Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiffs, desiring the same to be Directed to the Goaler, or KeÃ©per of the same Prison, to have the Body of such Prisoners before any His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties Iustices of the <hi>Kings-Bench,</hi> or <hi>Common-Pleas</hi> at some certain Day in any Term, to Answer the said Plantiff or Plantiffs upon his or their said Cause of Action; And that if the said Plantiff or Plantiffs at the said Day put into the said Court his or their Declaration, according to the said Original Writt against the said Prisoner being present at the Bar, the said person shall be bound to appear in person, or to put in an Attorney to appear for him in the said Action, and unless the said Defendant plead upon a Rule given to be out at the Eight Days at the least, after such Appearance Iudgment by <hi>Nihil dicit</hi> may be Entred against such De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendants as Appearing in person, which shall be Good and Effectual in Law: And such Charge in Court by Declarations signified by Rule unto the Goaler or KeÃ©per shall be a Good Cause of Detension of such Prisoner in his Custody, from which he shall not be Discharged without a Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>Supersedeas,</hi> or Rule of Court: And if the said Goaler or KeÃ©per shall do otherwise, he shall be Responsible to the Court, and to the Party

            <p>And whereas very many Suites Commenced by Original Writts have beÃ©n Protracted and long Delayed from Iudgment and Execution, by Reason of the Necessity of having FifteÃ©n Days, at the least, betweÃ©n the Days of the <hi>Teste,</hi> and the Days of the Return of Writts now Vsed in personal Actions, and also in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of <hi>Ejectione firme,</hi> for Lands and Tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.

And forasmuch as divers other Causes wherein the same Mischief by Delays and Staying of Execution by Writts of Errour and <hi>Supersedeas</hi> thereupon are not Provided for by the Statute in the several Actions hereafter Specified.</p>
            <p>Be it further Enacted, That the said Recited Act be of Force in this Kingdom.
